# Soho Frontend code assignment

Demo -> https://mystifying-kirch-03ce94.netlify.app

A simple [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) powered frontend that consumes the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) and lets users search by username. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) has been used for styling and the app is hosted using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Prerequisites

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 8.0 or greater installed on your system.

## Setup

Either clone this repository using git

```
git clone https://github.com/sanity-io/example-frontend-next-js.git
```

or [download the source code](https://github.com/himesh-salpo/soho-test/archive/main.zip) as a zip archive.

Once that's one, open the terminal in the project directory, and install dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

Then start the app with:

```
npm run dev
```

The app should now be up and running at http://localhost:3000
